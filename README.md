Quite literally what it says. A VERY primitive version of chess made in Prolog.

Can basically do what a real board can (or maybe less - it will prevent you from making any illegal moves).

If anyone knows how to make an automatic check / checkmate / etc detection, feel free to use my work and implement it!
